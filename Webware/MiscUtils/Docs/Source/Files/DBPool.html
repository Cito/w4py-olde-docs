<pre><span class="PY_STRING">"""DBPool.py

Implements a pool of cached connections to a database for any DB-API 2
compliant database module. This should result in a speedup for persistent
applications like Webware. The pool of connections is threadsafe regardless
of whether the used DB-API 2 general has a threadsafety of 1 or 2.

For more information on the DB API, see:
    http://www.python.org/topics/database/DatabaseAPI-2.0.html

The idea behind DBPool is that it's completely seamless, so once you have
established your connection, use it just as you would any other DB-API 2
compliant module. For example:

    import pgdb # import used DB-API 2 module
    from MiscUtils.DBPool import DBPool
    dbpool = DBPool(pgdb, 5, host=..., database=..., user=..., ...)
    db = dbpool.connection()

Now use "db" exactly as if it were a pgdb connection. It's really
just a proxy class.

db.close() will return the connection to the pool, not actually
close it. This is so your existing code works nicely.

DBPool is actually intended to be a demonstration of concept not to be
used in a productive environment. It is really a very simple solution with
several drawbacks. For instance, pooled database connections which have
become invalid are not automatically recovered. For a more sophisticated
solution, please have a look at the DBUtils package:
    http://www.webwareforpython.org/DBUtils
