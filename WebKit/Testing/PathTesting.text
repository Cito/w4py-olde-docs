Application's serverSidePathForRequest() method is fairly involved. It supports a variety of functionalites as described in it's doc string.

Here is a list of test cases, which should be executed ideally for every adapter, but at least for WebKit.cgi and OneShot.cgi. Assume a prefix, such as http://localhost/<Adapter>/. Also, try each one more than once in order to test that the caching is not buggy.

Another test case should be:

http://host/context/dir
http://host/context/dir/file

In that order. This could flush out problems with embedded servlets.

This hasn't been set up yet.
