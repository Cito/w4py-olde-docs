<a name=Synopsis><h2>Synopsis</h2></a>

<p> WebKit provides Python classes for generating dynamic content from a web-based, server-side application. It is a significantly more powerful alternative to CGI scripts for application-oriented development.


<a name=Feedback><h2>Feedback</h2></a>

<p> <p> You can e-mail <a href=mailto:webware-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net>webware-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net</a> to give feedback, discuss features and get help using WebKit.


<a name=Introduction><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<a name=Overview><h3>Overview</h3></a>

<p> The core concepts of the WebKit are the Application, Servlet, Request, Response and Transaction, for which there are one or more Python classes.

<p> The application resides on the server-side and manages incoming requests in order to deliver them to servlets which then produce responses that get sent back to the client. A transaction is a simple container object that holds references to all of these objects and is accessible to all of them.

<p> Content is normally served in HTML or XML format over an HTTP connection. However, applications can provide other forms of content and the framework is designed to allow new classes for supporting protocols other than HTTP.

<p> In order to connect the web server and the application server, there is a small CGI script, WebKit.cgi, that bundles a web browser request and sends it to the application server, which then processes it and sends the response back to WebKit.cgi which then outputs the results for use by the web server. See the <a href=InstallGuide.html>Install Guide</a> for more information.

<p> At a more detailed level, the process looks like this:

<ol>
	<li>At some point, someone has configured and run both a web server (such as Apache) and the WebKit app server (WebKit/AppServer.py).
	<li>A user requests a web page by typing a URL or submitting a form.
	<li>The user's browser sends the request to the remote web server.
	<li>The web server detects a CGI script, WebKit.cgi, in the URL and invokes it.
	<li>WebKit.cgi simply collects information about the request and sends it to the WebKit app server which is ready and waiting.
	<li>The app server asks the Application object to dispatch the raw request.
	<li>The application instantiates an HTTPRequest object and asks the appropriate Servlet (as determined by examining the URL) to process it.
	<li>The servlet generates content into a given HTTPResponse object, whose content is then sent back by the app server to WebKit.cgi.
	<li>WebKit.cgi prints the content which the web server then delivers to the user's web browser.
</ol>


<a name=CompareCGIs><h3>Compared to CGI "apps"</h3></a>

<p> The alternative to a server-side application is a set of CGI scripts. However, a CGI script must always be launched from scratch and many common tasks will be performed repeatedly for each request. For example, loading libraries, opening database connections, reading configuration files, etc.

<p> With the server-side application, the majority of these tasks can be done once at launch time and important  results can be easily cached. This the application significantly more efficient.

<p> Of course, CGIs can still be appropriate for "one shot" deals or simple applications. <a href=../../Documentation/Webware.html>Webware</a> includes a <a href=../../CGIWrapper/Documentation/CGIWrapper.html>CGI Wrapper</a> if you'd like to encapsulate your CGI scripts with robust error handling, e-mail notifications, etc.


<a name=Errors><h2>Errors / Uncaught Exceptions</h2></a>

<p>One of the conveniences provided by WebKit is the handling of uncaught exceptions. The response to an uncaught exception is:

<ol>
	<li> Log the time, error, script name and traceback to AppServer's console.
	<li> Display a web page containing an apologetic message to the user.
	<li> Save a technical web page with debugging information so that developers can look at it after-the-fact. These HTML-based error messages are stored one-per-file, if the <code>SaveErrorMessages</code> setting is true (the default). They are stored in the directory named by the <code>ErrorMessagesDir</code> (defaults to 'ErrorMsgs').
	<li> Add an entry to the error log, found by default in <i>Logs/Errors.csv</i>.
	<li> E-mail the error message if the <code>EmailErrors</code> setting is true, using the settings <code>ErrorEmailServer</code> and <code>ErrorEmailHeaders</code>. You'll need to <a href=#Configuration>configure</a> these to active this feature.
</ol>

<p>Here is a <a href=SampleError.html>sample error page</a>.

<p>Archived error messages can be browsed through the <a href=#Administration>administration page</a>.

<p>Error handling behavior can be configured as described in <a href=#Configuration>Configuration</a>.</p>


<a name=Configuration><h2>Configuration</h2></a>

<p>There are several configuration parameters through which you can alter how WebKit behaves. They are described below, including their default values. Note that you can override the defaults by placing config files in the <code>Configs/</code> directory. A config file simply contains a Python dictionary containing the items you wish to override. For example:

<p><code>{
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'ServletsDir': MyApp,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'ShowDebugInfoOnErrors': 1
<br>}</code>

<a name=Administration><h2>Administration</h2></a>

<p> WebKit has a built-in administration page that you can access by specifying <code>_admin</code> in the URL. This gives basic information and provides links to other administrative features like viewing the logs and configuration.

<p> The error log display also contains links to the archived error messages so that you can browse them.

<p> The adminstration scripts provide further examples of writing pages with WebKit, so you may wish to examine their source.

<p> Here's an <a href=SampleAdmin.html>example</a> of the admin page.

<p> The URL might look something like:

<p><code>http://www.host.com/WebKit.cgi/_admin</code>


<a name=Debugging><h2>Debugging</h2></a>

<p> As will all software development, you will need to debug your web application. The most popular techniques are detailed below.


<a name=Debugging_print><h3>print</h3></a>

<p> The most common technique is the infamous <code>print</code> statement. The results of <code>print</code> statements go to the console where the WebKit application server was started (not to the HTML page as would happen with CGI). Prefixing the debugging output with a special tag (such as >>) is useful because it stands out on the console and you can search for the tag in source code to remove the print statements after they are no longer useful. For example:

<p><code>print '<b>&gt;&gt;</b> fields =', self._request.fields()</code>


<a name=Debugging_Raising><h3>Raising Exceptions</h3></a>

<p> Uncaught expections are trapped at the application level where a useful error page is saved with information such as the traceback, environment, fields, etc. You can configure the application to automatically e-mail you this information. Here is an <a href=SampleError.html>example error page</a>.

<p> When an application isn't behaving correctly, raising an exception can be useful because of the additional information that comes with it. Exceptions can be coupled with messages, thereby turning them into more powerful versions of the <code>print</code> statement. For example:

<p><code>raise Exception, 'self = %s' % self</code>


<a name=Debugging_Restarting><h3>Restarting the Server</h3></a>

<p> Servlet <i>super classes</i> don't get reloaded by the AppServer. Also, Webware can still be unstable due to it's early age. If a problem becomes unsolvable, restart the server and see if it still occurs on the first attempt.


<a name=Assertions><h3>Assertions</h3></a>

<p> Assertions are used to ensure that the internal conditions of the application are as expected. An assertion is equivalent to an <code>if</code> statement coupled with an exception. For example:

<p><code>assert shoppingCart.total()>=0.0, 'shopping cart total is %0.2f' % shoppingCart.total()</code>


<a name=NamingConventions><h2>Naming Conventions</h2></a>

<p>Cookies and form values that are named with surrounding underscores (such as <code>_sid_</code> and <code>_action_</code>) are reserved by WebKit for it's own internal purposes. If you refrain from using surrounding underscores in your own names, then [a] you won't accidentally clobber an already existing internal name and [b] when new names are introduced by future versions of WebKit, they won't break your application.


<a name=Actions><h2>Actions</h2></a>

<p> Suppose you have a web page with a form and one or more buttons. Normally, when the form is submitted, a method such as Servlet's <code>respondToPost()</code> or Page's <code>writeHTML()</code>, will be invoked. However, you may find it more useful to bind the button to a specific method of your servlet such as <code>new()</code>, <code>remove()</code> etc. to implement the command, and reserve <code>writeHTML()</code> for displaying the page. Note that your "command methods" can then invoke <code>writeHTML()</code> after performing their task.

<p> The <i>action</i> feature of Page let's you do this. The process goes like this:

<p> <b>1.</b> Add buttons to your HTML form of type <code>submit</code> and name <code>_action_</code>. For example:

<p><code>&lt;input name=_action_ type=submit value=New&gt;
<br>&lt;input name=_action_ type=submit value=Delete&gt;</code>

<p> <b>2.</b> Add an <code>actions()</code> method to your class to state which actions are valid. This is security requirement is important. Without it, hackers could invoke any servlet method they wanted! For example:

<p> <code>def actions(self): return <i>SuperClass</i>.actions(self) + ['New', 'Delete']</code>

<p> <b>3.</b> Unfortunately, the HTML submit button does not separate it's value from it's title/label. If your button labels don't match your method names, you will need to implement <code>methodNameForAction()</code> to provide the mapping. You could simply use a dictionary to create the mapping, or if you know there is some relationship you could write the logic for it. For example,

<p><code>def methodNameForAction(self, name): return string.lower(name)</code>

<p> <b>4.</b> Now you implement your action methods.

<p> The ListBox example shows the use of actions.


<a name=PlugIns><h2>Plug-ins</h2></a>

<p>	A plug-in is a software component that is loaded by WebKit in order to provide additional WebKit functionality without necessarily having to modify WebKit's source.

<p>The most infamous plug-in is PSP (Python Server Pages) which ships with Webware.

<p> Plug-ins often provide additional servlet factories, servlet subclasses, examples and documentation. Ultimately, it is the plug-in author's choice as to what to provide and in what manner.

<p> Technically, plug-ins are Python packages that follow a few simple conventions in order to work with WebKit. More information can be found in PlugIn.py's doc strings. You can learn more about Python packages in the Python Tutorial, 6.4: "Packages" at http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/node8.html#SECTION008400000000000000000).


<a name=Files><h2>Files</h2></a>

<p> <b>*.py</b> - Mostly the implementation of the various classes of the framework, except as noted below.

<p> <b>WebKit.cgi</b> - A simple script that imports and runs WebKitCGIAdaptor. This also results in a cached byte code version of WebKitCGIAdapator (e.g., a <code>.pyc</code>) (provided you have write permission, of course).

<p> <b>CGIAdaptor.py</b> - A program that collects HTTP requests together in a dictionary and passes them to the app server for processing. This allows WebKit applications to work with any web server that supports CGI.

<p> <b>FCGIAdaptor.py</b> - Like CGIAdaptor, but in accordance with the <a href=http://www.fastcgi.com>FastCGI</a> protocol for improved performance.

<p> <b>address.text</b> - The hostname and port of the AppServer are written to this file when it starts up. The CGI and FastCGI adaptors read this in order to communicate with the AppServer.

<p> <b>Config/AppServer.config</b> - configuration file for the AppServer

<p> <b>Config/Application.config</b> - configuration file for the Application

<p> <b>Logs/Access.csv</b> - The log of servlets/pages accessed through the server as described above.

<p> <b>Logs/Errors.csv</b> - The log of uncaught exceptions including date & time, exception and link to debugging page if one was saved.

<p> <b>ErrorMsgs/Error-<i>scriptname</i>-<i>YYYY</i>-<i>MM</i>-<i>DD</i>-<i>*</i>.py</b> - Archived error messages.


<a name=How><h2>How do I develop an app?</h2></a>

<p> The answer to that question might not seem clear after being deluged with all the details. Here's a summary:

<ol>
	<li> Make sure you can run the WebKit AppServer. See the <a href=InstallGuide.html>Install Guide</a> for more information.
	<li> Read the source to the examples (in WebKit/Examples), then modify one of them to get your toes wet.
	<li> Create your own new example from scratch. Ninety-nine percent of the time you will be subclassing the <b>Page</b> class.
	<li> Familiarize yourself with the class docs in order to take advantage of classes like Page, HTTPRequest, HTTPResponse and Session. Unfortunately, I couldn't get generated class docs working for this release, so you'll have to resort to breezing through the source code which is coupled with documentation strings. Read the examples first.
	<li> With this additional knowledge, create more sophisticated pages.
	<li> Contribute enhancements and bug fixes back to the project. &nbsp; <kbd>:-)</kbd>
	<li> Make sure you find out about new versions when they're released: Subscribe to the announcements list at <a href=http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/webware-announce>http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/webware-announce</a>.
