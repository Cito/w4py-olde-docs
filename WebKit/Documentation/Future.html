<h1>WebKit Future Work</h1>
Version 0.4
<br>Webware for Python 0.4


<a name=Future><h2>Future Work/Limitations</h2></a>

<p> Sprinkled throughout the code are comments tagged with <b>@@</b> which are hopefully accompanied by a date and someone's initials. These comments represent "TO BE DONE"s. The double at-sign (@@) convention was chosen because it doesn't appear to be used for anything else.

<p> In addition to the inline comments, some significant items have been recorded below. These are future ideas, with no committments or timelines as to when/if they'll be realized. The Python WebKit is open source, so feel free to jump in!

<p> The numbers below are mostly for reference, although longer term items tend to be pushed towards the bottom.


<a name=KnownBugs><h3>Known Bugs</h3></a>

<ol>
	<li> The ListBox example does not take kindly to a Refresh/Reload after a delete operation. In essence, you are telling the ListBox to delete the same object twice.
	<li> Problems have been reported with cookies on MS IE for the Mac.
	<li> On Netscape 4.7, when browsing through the Servlet examples, the [BACK] button of the browser doesn't seem to keep a history. This is pretty strange. Also, this hasn't been confirmed or tested in a long time.
	<li> The OneShot adapter does not clean old sessions when using SessionFileStore.
	<li> If a context appears in the Contexts setting once by name and once as the default, Application seems to load it twice.
</ol>


<a name=ToDo><h3>To Do</h3></a>

<ol>
	<li> <b>Major Items</b>
		<ol>
		<li> Rearchitect app servers, applications, contexts, etc. One process per application (not several applications per process). Don't worry though. 99% of servlet code will be unaffected by these changes.
		<li> CheckSource.py: A program to check the source code conventions.
		<li> FormKit: A plug-in to aid the construction and validation of forms. (Already in progress.)
		<li> Page: Add features for style sheets.
		<li> Role-based security and user-authentication. Goal is to eliminate, as much as possible, developer-written security logic. This should be provided by the WebKit and be configurable.
		<li> Write a custom adaptor for Apache, Netscape, MS, etc.
		<li> Write a CGI adaptor in C for increased performance.
		<li> Distribution and load balancing.
		<li> Fault tolerance.
		<li> More sophisticated admin tools including password protection, clearing logs, displaying a maximum of information at a time, etc. Consider using module 'resource'.
		<li> Investigate case insensitive URLs, especially for the Windows platform.
		<li> Plug-ins
			<ol>
			<li> In admin page, provide links to docs
			<li> In ExamplePage, automatically support examples of any plug-in
			<li> Better docs
			<li> Properties.config. 'Load', 0, 1 or the name of the required op sys
			</ol>
		</ol>

	<li> <b>General</b>
		<ol>
		<li> Hunt down: @@ tags (which signify "To Be Done"s), FUTURE items in class doc strings, NotImplementedErrors, -- tags
		<li> Code clean up.
		<li> Right now, if the Application itself (as opposed to Servlets) throws an exception, it doesn't get captured nicely. However, it is displayed in the app server's console.
		<li> The exception handler is pretty nice and has features like logging, e-mail, gathering debugging info, etc. However, on occasions it can throw exceptions too. There should be a simpler, secondary exception handler for when this happens.
		<li> Review the timestamp caching logic and its relation to .pyc files if any.
		<li> AppServer: Servlets get reloaded when they are changed, but not the Servlets ancestor classes.
		<li> Add "Last-modified:" to generic files that are served via WebKit.
		<li> Change the raw response format to a MIME header looking format (rather than a marshalled Python dictionary).
		<li> If a Python file has only one class that inherits from Servlet, then use that as the Servlet class (rather than requiring the name be the same as the file).
		<li> Have the generic file servlet cache it's files.
		</ol>

	<li> <b>Testing</b>
		<ol>
		<li> Provide testing web page where people can report their testing results including version numbers, etc.
		<li> Provide higher level automation of testing. For example, a testing script should be able to launch various app servers multiple times.
		<li> Provide highly automated benchmarking so we can track changes in performance.
		<li> Expand the regression test suite.
		<li> Investigate <a href=http://pyunit.sourceforge.net>http://pyunit.sourceforge.net</a>.
		</ol>

	<li> <b>Docs</b>
		<ol>
		<li> Beef up the User's Guide.
		<li> User's Guide: Create a caching section to discuss the virtues of doing so. Color example became 12 X faster on the server side.
		<li> Create a tutorial.
		<li> Docs: Provide links to 'pythondoc' generated documentation of the classes.
		</ol>

	<li> <b>Food for thought, considerations, reviews</b>
		<ol>
		<li> Consider this statement from the FastCGI docs: Redirects are handled similar to CGI.  Location headers with values that begin with "/" are treated as internal-redirects; otherwise, they are treated as external redirects (302).
		<li> Consider how Pages might be nested. Consider if a different name is in order.
		<li> Consider if we need to support &lt;form action="x.py?a=1" method="POST"&gt; where you will have both a query string and posted data.
		<li> What are the implications of multi-threading for servlets?
		<li> Application modifies sys.path so that servlets can say "from SuperServlet import SuperServlet" where SuperServlet is located in the same directory as the Servlet. We'd prefer a more sophisticated technique which does not modify sys.path and does not affect other servlets. (Or maybe this would go away with a new one-process-per-application architecture.)

		</ol>

	<li> <b>Down the road</b>
		<ol>
		<li> Multi-language support/localization (e.g., vend data to clients in their preferred written language)
		<li> Consider CORBA standard RMI-IIOP and it's potential interaction with WebKit. This technology has been marked for inclusion in J2EE. I imagine the idea might be that an app server could be used by more than just web browsers. e.g., it could be used programmatically (in a more natural way than simulating a web client).
