<h1>WebKit 0.6 Release Notes</h1>
Version 0.6b3 - <b>beta 3</b>
<br>Webware for Python 0.6


<a name=Introduction><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<ul>
	<li> Version 0.6b3 was released on 11/28/2001.
	<li> These release notes are very much incomplete.
</ul>


<h2>Major API Changes</h2>

<ul>

	<li> The Page class interface was refactored with regards to various writeFoo() methods. The changes make it much easier for a subclass to customize and extend what it inherits from its superclass.

	<p> If you have existing subclasses, you will need to make some quick changes before your pages look right. The largest change is to rename writeBody() methods to writeContent(). Also, if you override writeHeader(), you will want to refactor it, possibly by overriding writeStyleSheet() and writeHeadParts() (taking care to invoke super before adding your customizations).

	<p> Please review the Page <a href=Source/Summaries/Page.py.html>summary</a> and doc strings in the <a href=Source/Files/Page.py.html>source code</a> for details.

	<p> If you feel burdened by updating your existing page methods, you can quickly change their inheritance to Page051 (<a href=Source/Summaries/Page051.py.html>summary</a>, <a href=Source/Files/Page051.py.html>source</a>), a new class which sports the old style of write methods found in WebKit 0.5.1.

</ul>


<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>

	<li> The Request object will parse GET style variables even in a POST request.  So parameters can be passed to WebKit both as POST variables and as part of the URL in the same request.

</ul>


<h2>Improvements and Refinements</h2>

<ul>

	<li> The headers in HTTPResponse are now case insensitive.

	<li> UnknownFileTypeServlet can response to HEAD and will not include the contents of the file. [Ken L]

	<li> HTTPServlet now implements a basic HEAD request. (The GNU wget program will now work on a WebKit site.) [Ken L]

</ul>



<h2>Security</h2>

<ul>
	<li> Sessions ids are harder to guess. [Ken L]
</ul>



<h2>Minor API Changes</h2>

We don't track every change to the interface, but here are some notables:

<ul>
	<li> Add Session.invalidate() method to clear out a session.
	<li> Add dictionary style access to Session object values. [Jay L]
	<li> HTTPServlet will now invoke respondToFoo() for any FOO HTTP request method. If not implemented, the response is now an HTTP 501 Not Implemented (prior WebKits raised a SubclassResponsibilityError). [Ken L]
</ul>


<h2>Bugfixes</h2>

<ul>

	<li>  Make Application.isSessionIDProblematic use the session's custom timeout.


</ul>
