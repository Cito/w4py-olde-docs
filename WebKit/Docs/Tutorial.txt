Synopsis
========

We present a tutorial on making a Webware script, and some guidance on turning that into a web application.

Installation
============

This document does not cover the basic installation.  See the `Install Guide`_
-- you should be able to open up the Examples context in Webware before you continue.

.. _`Install Guide`: InstallGuide.html

Setting Up Your Environment
===========================

Creating a Working Directory
----------------------------

We'll first set up a directory dedicated to your application.  Run this command::

    $ cd ~
    $ python /path/to/Webware/bin/MakeAppWorkDir.py -l --cvsignore \
      -c context WebwareTest

You'll now have a directory WebwareTest in your home directory (or of course you can put it in some other location).  Inside this directory will be several subdirectories and a couple files.  The only file we'll worry about is ``AppServer`` (or ``AppServer.bat`` if you're on Windows).  The directories of interest are ``context`` (that you specified with ``-c context``) where you'll be putting your servlets; ``Configs`` that holds some configuration files; and ``lib`` where you can put your non-servlet code.

For more information about the working directory and setting up the file structure for your application, see `Application Development`_.

.. _`Application Development`: ApplicationDevelopment.html

Changing Webware Configuration
------------------------------

For the most part the configuration is fine, but we'll make a couple changes to make it easier to develop.  For more information on configuration see the `Configuration Guide`_.

.. _`Configuration Guide`: Configuration.html

In the file ``AppServer.config``, change this line::

    # Original (default setting):
        'AutoReload': 0,
    # To:
        'AutoReload': 1,

This will cause the AppServer to restart if any loaded files are changed -- without this you may edit a file and your application won't see the updated version until you manually restart the AppServer.

The other change you may want to make to allow you to use more interesting URLs.  In Application.config::

    # Original (default setting):
        'ExtraPathInfo': 0,
    # To:
        'ExtraPathInfo': 1,
        
Otherwise the settings should be appropriate for development.  (There are several you would want to change before deploying the application in a production environment).

Creating and Understanding the Servlet
======================================

Webware's core concept for serving pages is the *servlet*.  This is a class that creates a response given a request.

The core classes to understanding the servlet are ``Servlet``, ``HTTPServlet``, and ``Page``.  Also of interest would be the request (``Request`` and ``HTTPRequest``) and the response (``Response`` and ``HTTPResponse``) -- the ``HTTP-`` versions of these classes are more interesting.  There is also a ``Transaction`` object, which is solely a container for the request and response.

While there are several levels you can work on while creating your servlet, in this tutorial we will work solely with subclassing the ``Page`` class.  This class defines a more high-level interface, appropriate for generating HTML (though it can be used with any content type).  It also provides a number of convenience methods.

A Brief Introduction to the Servlet
===================================

Each servlet is a plain Python class.  There is no Webware magic (except perhaps for the level one *import module based on URL* spell).  PSP has more magic, but that's a topic for another day. (@@ ib: link to PSP doc)  An extremely simple servlet might look like::

    from WebKit.Page import Page
    
    class MyServlet(Page):
    
        def title(self):
            return 'My Sample Servlet'
            
        def writeContent(self):
            self.write('Hello world!')
            
This would be placed in ``MyServlet.py``.  Webware will create a pool of ``MyServlet`` instances, which will be reused.  Servlets "write" the text of the response (like ``self.write("some text")``).  Webware calls the servlet like this:

* An unused servlet is taken from the pool, or another servlet is created.
* ``awake(transaction)`` is called.  This is a good place to set up data
  for your servlet.  You can put information in instance variables for use later
  on.  But be warned -- those instance variables will hang around potentially
  for a long time if you don't delete them later (in ``sleep``).
* Several low-level methods are called, which Page isolates you from.  We will
  ignore these.
* ``writeHTML()`` is called.  ``Page`` implements this just fine, but you
  can override it if you want total control, or if you want to output something
  other than HTML.
* ``writeDocType()`` would write something like ``<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC 
  "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"   
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">``
* The <head> section of the page is written.  ``title()`` gives the title, and
  you probably want to override it.
* ``writeStyleSheet()`` is called, if you want to write that or anything else in
  the <head> section.
* The <body> tag is written.  Have ``htBodyArgs()`` return anything you want in
  the <body> tag (like ``onLoad="loadImages()"``)
* ``writeBodyParts()`` is called, which you may want to override if you want
  to create a template for other servlets.
* ``writeContent()`` should write the main content for the page.  This is where
  you do most of your display work.
* The response is packaged up, the headers put on the front, cookies handled,
  and it's sent to the browser.  This is all done for you.
* ``sleep(transaction)`` is called.  This is where you should clean up anything
  you might have set up earlier -- open files, open database connections, etc.
  Often it's empty.
* The servlet is placed back into the pool, to be used again.  This only happens
  after the transaction is complete -- the servlet won't get reused any earlier.
  
You only have to override the portions that you want to.  It is not uncommon to only override the ``writeContent()`` method in a servlet, for instance.

You'll notice a file ``context/Main.py`` in your working directory.  You can look at it to get a feel for what a servlet might look like.  (As an aside, a servlet called ``Main`` or ``index`` will be used analogous to the ``index.html`` file).  You can look at it for a place to start experimenting, but here we'll work on developing an entire (small) application, introducing the other concepts as we go along.

A Photo Album
=============

If you look online, you'll see a huge number of web applications available for an online photo album.  The world needs one more!

You will need the Python Imaging Library (@@ ib: link) installed for this example.  First we'll use it to find the sizes of the images, and later we will use it to create thumbnails.

We'll develop the application in iterations -- the iterations are numbered in ``WebKit/Examples/PhotoAlbum/VersionX``.  

Iteration 1: Displaying Files
-----------------------------

For the first iteration, we'll display files that you upload by hand.  We do this with two servlets -- one to show the entire album, and another for individual pictures.  First, the entire album::

    from WebKit.Page import Page
    import os
    import Image
    dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)), "pics")
    
    class Main(Page):
    
        def title(self):
            # It's nice to give a real title, otherwise "Main" would
            # be used.
            return 'Photo Album'

        def writeContent(self):
            # We'll format these simpy, one thumbnail per line.
            for filename in os.listdir(dir):
                filename = os.path.join(dir, filename)
                im = Image.open(filename)
                x, y = im.size
                # Here we figure out the scaled-down size of the image,
                # so that we preserve the aspect ratio.  We'll use fake
                # thumbnails, where the image is scaled down by the browser.
                x = int(x * (100.0 / y))
                y = 100
                # note that we are just using % substitution to generate
                # the HTML.  There's other ways, but this works well enough.
                # We're linking to the View servlet which we'll show later.
                # Notice we use urlEncode -- otherwise we'll encounter bugs
                # if there's a file with an embedded space or other character
                # in it.
                self.write('<p><a href="View?filename=%s">'
                           % self.urlEncode(filename))
                self.write('<img src="../pics/%s" width="%i" height="%i">'
                           % (self.urlEncode(filename), x, y))
                self.write('</a></p>\n')

The servlet ``View`` takes one URL parameter of ``filename`` -- you can get the value of a URL parameter like ``self.field('filename')`` -- or, if you want a default value, you can use ``self.field('filename', defaultValue)``.  The ``field`` method is also in the ``HTTPRequest`` class, so you'll often see people do something like::

    req = self.request()
    self.write(req.field('username'))

The ``Page`` class just provides a shortcut.  The individual images are viewed with this servlet::

    from WebKit.Page import Page
    import os
    import Image
    dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)), "pics")
    
    class View(Page):
    
        def title(self):
            return 'View: %s' % self.htmlEncode(self.field('filename'))
            
        def writeContent(self):
            filename = self.field('filename')
            im = Image.open(os.path.join(dir, filename))
            self.write('<center>')
            self.write('<img src="../pics/%s" width="%i" height="%i">'
                       % (self.urlEncode(filename), im.size[0], im.size[1]))
            self.write('<br>\n')
            self.write(filename)
            self.write('<p>\n')
            self.write('<a href="./">Return to Index</a>')
            self.write('</center>')
