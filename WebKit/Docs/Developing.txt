Creating Plugins
================

Each plugin is a directory.  WebKit finds plugins using the
``PlugIns`` and ``PluginDirs`` -- see Configuration_.

.. _Configuration: Configuration.html#appserverconfig

A plug-in must have ``__init__.py`` and ``Properties.py`` files. You
can disable a specific plug-in by placing a ``dontload`` file in it.

@@ ib: document __init__.py, Properties.py
