Developing Webware
++++++++++++++++++

This document should outline the details you need to understand to
Webware and WebKit internals, and assist in becoming an advanced
Webware programmer.

Creating Plugins
================

Each plugin is a Python Package.  WebKit finds plugins using the
``PlugIns`` and ``PluginDirs`` -- see Configuration_.  See also the
`Python tutorial on packages`__ and the ``Plugin.py`` doc string.

A plug-in must have ``__init__.py`` and ``Properties.py`` files. You
can disable a specific plug-in by placing a ``dontload`` file in it.
