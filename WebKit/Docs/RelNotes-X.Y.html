<h2>Major Changes</h2>
<ul>
	<li> *
</ul>


<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>

	<li> Added If-Modified-Since support to HTTPServlet. A Servlet can provide a 
		lastModified() method which returns the modification time of the data.
		This has been integrated into the UnknownFileType servlet for handling
		static files.

	<li> AppServer script detects -u (unbuffered output) and -O (optimize) 
		parameters and passes them to python.  These parameters must precede 
		any other parameters.  Other parameters will be passed to 
		ThreadedAppServer normally.

	<li> Configuration files can be written as Python modules
	     instead of as python dictionaries.  Any global variables
	     in the module are equivalent to top-level keys in the
	     configuration dictionary.

	<li> MakeAppWorkDir.py accepts options to point the default
	     context to a location not inside the workdir, so you can
	     keep your code completely separate from the workdir.  It
	     also accepts options to add multiple application library
	     dirs to the Python path.

	<li> Added 'EnterDebuggerOnException' option to Application.config.
		 If true, and if the AppServer is running from an interactive 
		 terminal, an uncaught exception will cause the AppServer to 
		 enter the debugger, allowing the developer to call functions, 
		 investigate variables, etc.  See python debugger (pdb) docs 
		 for more information.  You will certainly want to turn this off 
		 when deploying the site.  Defaults to 0 (off).

	<li> The AppServer now includes an experimental built-in web server.
		 See the InstallGuide for more details.

	<li> Added new Application.config option "UseCookieSessions" that
		 defaults to True.  If set to False, then a session cookie will
		 never be sent in the response.  Use this along with
		 UseAutomaticPathSessions to ONLY use path sessions and never
		 use cookie sessions.
</ul>


<h2>Improvements and Refinements</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Fixed incompatibility between the NT Service code and
  win32all 163.
	<li> AutoReload no longer catches servlet updates (since
	     servlets can be reloaded without restarting the entire
	     server).
	<li> XMLRPCServlet now allows xmlrpclib.Fault exceptions to be
	     passed through unmolested.
	<li> <p>Previously, attempting to start an already-running AppServer 
		 would fail when it couldn't grab the socket to listen on, but it 
		 would have already overwritten the pid file.</p>

		 <p>Now pid file handling is much improved:

		 <ul>
		 <li>The AppServer will refuse to start if it detects that the pid file 
		 exists and the process is still running.
		 <li>A stale pid file left over from a crash or forcible termination
		 will be detected and removed.
		 <li>You can override the path of the pid file using the "PidFile" 
		 setting in AppServer.config.  By default, the pid is written to the 
		 "appserverpid.txt" in the working directory (or webkit path if you're 
		 not using a working dir)
		 </ul>

	<li> Page has been refactored into HTTPContent and Page.  HTTPContent
		 can be used as a base class for servlets which generate non-HTML
		 content.  As Page inherits from HTTPContent (which inherits from 
		 HTTPServlet), Page still contains all the methods it previously did,
		 and this change should not require any changes to end-user code.
</ul>


<h2>Security</h2>
<ul>
	<li> *
</ul>


<h2>Minor API Changes</h2>
<ul>
	<li> The 'Port' setting in AppServer.config has been deprecated in favor
	     of the new 'AdapterPort' setting.  The 'Port' setting in your config 
		 file will still be honored, but you are encouraged to update your 
		 AppServer.config as the 'Port' setting will be removed in the future.
</ul>


<h2>Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Fixed handling of expired sessions.  Previously, if you tried to access an expired session
		before the session sweeper thread had cleaned it out, you'd get that expired session for
		one request, but on the second request you'd get a new session.  Now it correctly returns
		a new empty session with a new session ID on the first request after expiration.

    <li> New debugging feature: by turning on the configuration
  variable IncludeErrorLink in Application.config, an [edit] link
  will be put next to each line in tracebacks.  That link will
  point to a file of type application/x-webkit-edit-file, which
  you should configure your browser to run with 
  Webware/bin/editfile.py (and edit editfile.py so that it opens
  your editor).

    <li> In WebKit.Page, removed use of the internal method _actionSet()
	which cached the list of actions for the servlet.  This was redundant 
	code, and its removal allows a servlet to use dynamic actions (i.e. to 
	make the action list dependent on the permissions of the logged-in user).  
	Note that _actionSet() is still used for "old-style" actions to maintain 
	backwards compatibility.
</ul>
