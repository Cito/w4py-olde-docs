<h2>Major Changes</h2>
<ul>
	<li> *
</ul>


<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>

	<li> Added If-Modified-Since support to HTTPServlet. A Servlet can provide a 
		lastModified() method which returns the modification time of the data.
		This has been integrated into the UnknownFileType servlet for handling
		static files.

	<li> AppServer script detects -u (unbuffered output) and -O (optimize) 
		parameters and passes them to python.  These parameters must precede 
		any other parameters.  Other parameters will be passed to 
		ThreadedAppServer normally.

	<li> Configuration files can be written as Python modules
	     instead of as python dictionaries.  Any global variables
	     in the module are equivalent to top-level keys in the
	     configuration dictionary.

	<li> MakeAppWorkDir.py accepts options to point the default
	     context to a location not inside the workdir, so you can
	     keep your code completely separate from the workdir.  It
	     also accepts options to add multiple application library
	     dirs to the Python path.
  
</ul>


<h2>Improvements and Refinements</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Fixed incompatibility between the NT Service code and win32all 163.
</ul>


<h2>Security</h2>

<h2>Minor API Changes</h2>

	<li> *
</ul>


<h2>Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Fixed handling of expired sessions.  Previously, if you tried to access an expired session
		before the session sweeper thread had cleaned it out, you'd get that expired session for
		one request, but on the second request you'd get a new session.  Now it correctly returns
		a new empty session with a new session ID on the first request after expiration.

    <li> New debugging feature: by turning on the configuration
  variable IncludeErrorLink in Application.config, an [edit] link
  will be put next to each line in tracebacks.  That link will
  point to a file of type application/x-webkit-edit-file, which
  you should configure your browser to run with 
  Webware/bin/editfile.py (and edit editfile.py so that it opens
  your editor).

    <li> In WebKit.Page, removed use of the internal method _actionSet()
	which cached the list of actions for the servlet.  This was redundant 
	code, and its removal allows a servlet to use dynamic actions (i.e. to 
	make the action list dependent on the permissions of the logged-in user).  
	Note that _actionSet() is still used for "old-style" actions to maintain 
	backwards compatibility.
</ul>
