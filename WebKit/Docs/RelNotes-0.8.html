<h1>WebKit 0.8 Release Notes</h1>
Version 0.8
<br>Webware for Python 0.8


<a name=Introduction><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<ul>
	<li> Version 0.8 was released on @@/@@/2002.
</ul>


<h2>Major Changes</h2>

<ul>

	<li> *

</ul>


<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
	<li> *

</ul>

</ul>


<h2>Improvements and Refinements</h2>

<ul>

	<li> New setting 'ReportRPCExceptionsInWebKit': 1 means report exceptions in RPC servlets in the same way as exceptions in other servlets, i.e. in the logfiles, the error log, and/or by email.  0 means don't report the exceptions on the server side at all; this is useful if your RPC servlets are raising exceptions by design and you don't want to be notified.  Note that in release 0.7, there was no exception reporting on the server side in RPC servlets; if you want to get the same behavior in this release you'll have to set this setting to 0.

	<li> New methods in HTTPRequest:
		<ul>
			<li><b>originalURLPath()</b> - Returns the URL path of the original servlet before any forwarding.
			<li><b>siteRoot()</b> - Returns the URL path components necessary to get back home from the current location.
				<p>Examples:
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'../'
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'../../'
				<p>You can use this as a prefix to a URL that you know is based off
				the home location.  Any time you are in a servlet that may have been
				forwarded to from another servlet at a different level,
				you should prefix your URL's with this.  That is, if servlet "Foo/Bar"
				forwards to "Qux", then the qux servlet should use siteRoot() to construct all
				links to avoid broken links.  This works properly because this method
				computes the path based on the original servlet, not the location of the
				servlet that you have forwarded to.
			<li><b>siteRootFromCurrentServlet()</b> - Similar to siteRoot() but instead, it returns the site root
				relative to the current servlet, not the original servlet.
			<li><b>servletPathFromSiteRoot()</b> - Returns the "servlet path" of this servlet relative to the siteRoot.  In
				other words, everything after the name of the context (if present).
				If you append this to the result of self.siteRoot() you get back to the
				current servlet.  This is useful for saving the path to the current servlet
				in a database, for example.
		</ul>
</ul>



<h2>Security</h2>

<ul>
	<li> A buffer overflow in wkcgi was fixed.  Not only was this a security hole, but it also prevented large requests (&gt;8K) from working at all.  For Windows users who don't have Visual C++ handy, a compiled wkcgi.exe is available on the Webware home page in the MiscDownloads area.
</ul>



<h2>Minor API Changes</h2>

We don't track every change to the interface, but here are some notables:

<ul>
	<li> *
</ul>


<h2>Bugfixes</h2>

<ul>

	<li> Fixed a bug in the config setting UseCascadingExtensions and added .tmpl (used by Cheetah) to the default list of extensions to ignore.

	<li> Modified session code so that the session cookie is removed from the client when the session expires.
</ul>
