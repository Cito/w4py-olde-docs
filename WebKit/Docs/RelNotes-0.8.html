<h2>Improvements and Refinements</h2>

<ul>

	<li> New setting 'ReportRPCExceptionsInWebKit': 1 means report exceptions in RPC servlets in the same way as exceptions in other servlets, i.e. in the logfiles, the error log, and/or by email.  0 means don't report the exceptions on the server side at all; this is useful if your RPC servlets are raising exceptions by design and you don't want to be notified.  Note that in release 0.7, there was no exception reporting on the server side in RPC servlets; if you want to get the same behavior in this release you'll have to set this setting to 0.
