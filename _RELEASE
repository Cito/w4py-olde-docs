Webware for Python
Release Procedures

@@ 2000-06-06 ce: to do: This should be an HTML file in Documentation/.
The only text files we really need in the main dir are _README, _COPYRIGHT
and _VERSION.

@@ 2000-06-06 ce: These are the first release docs after creating the
CVS repository on sourceforge. They have to get checked in before
cutting the release, but then they could turn out to be wrong when the
release is being cut. So take a big grain of salt.  ;-)


Final tweaking
--------------
* Search for @@ in both source docs
* Skim through docs one final time
    * Make sure all the version numbers and dates are correct.


Final testing
-------------
* Close all source files (to reduce the chances of making changes that
  go untested)
* Check out a _new_ copy of the repository.
* Restart webserver
* Restart web client
* Test CGI Wrapper by trying all examples
* Test WebKit
	* Test _admin first. Check that viewing empty logs is handled gracefully.
	* Test the examples.
    * When testing examples, be sure to test links at bottom of page for
      things like viewing the source
    * Run Testing/stress.py
