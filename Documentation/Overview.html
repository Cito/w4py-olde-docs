<h1>Webware for Python</h1>
Release 0.4.1 on 10/05/2000
<br><a href=http://webware.sourceforge.net>http://webware.sourceforge.net</a>


<h2>Synopsis</h2>


<p> Webware for Python is a suite of software components for developing web-based applications that are object-oriented, cached and multi-threaded. The suite uses well known design patterns such as servlets and server pages (as found in ASP, PHP and JSP).

<p> Key goals of the project include:

<ul>
	<li> Python- and object-oriented.
	<li> An expansive suite of components and features to cover common needs of web developers.
	<li> Modular architecture where components can be used together or independently.
	<li> Excellent documentation and numerous examples.
	<li> Open source development and community.
</ul>


<h2>Feedback and Support</h2>

<p> You can e-mail <a href=mailto:webware-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net>webware-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net</a> to give feedback, discuss features and get help using Webware.


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p> Be sure to run <b>install.py</b> in the Webware directory before proceeding. Some portions of the documentation will not be accessible until this is done.


<h2>Description</h2>

<p> Each Webware component has a focused purpose and can often be used on it's own. At the same time, the components are designed to work together where appropriate. As a user of Webware, you can bite off as much or as little as you want to chew.

<p> Most people start with <a href=../WebKit/Documentation/index.html>WebKit</a>, which is the Webware application server.

<p>All the components are summarized in the <a href=ComponentIndex.html>Component Index</a>.


<h2>Status</h2>

<p> Webware is currently being used in at least three known commercial endeavors, two of which are by people outside the main Webware project. This recent use has lead to a host of improvements in the API, stability, test suites and documentation, that have contributed to this latest release.

<p> With support from the <a href=http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/webware-discuss>webware-discuss</a> mailing list, you should feel comfortable developing with Webware.

<p> However, there are a few warnings:

<ul>
	<li> The servlet and PSP APIs are fairly stable, but we're not guaranteeing backwards compatibility in new releases (designing the best API is the first priority).
	<li> You will still find some features lacking as with any work-in-progress.
	<li> There is no set timeline for when Webware will be final, production quality (although you have access to the source and could always fix what you need for your site, usually with the help of the team). Some goals for 1.0 include:
	<ul>
		<li> Larger regression test suite.
		<li> Even better documentation.
		<li> Tutorial.
		<li> Even more real-life applications.
		<li> WebKit AppServer:
		<ul>
			<li> Better handling of its own uncaught exceptions (it already deals well with servlet-generated exceptions).
			<li> Fault tolerance
			<li> Load balancing
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p> You can keep up on new releases through the <i>very low traffic</i> <a href=http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/webware-announce>announcement list</a> and the home page at <a href=http://webware.sourceforge.net>http://webware.sourceforge.net</a>.


<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p> Webware could always use contributors in various areas, some of them lightweight and some of them not. Consider all the fun things you could do:
<ul>
	<li> Test pre-releases on your favorite OS, web server and version of Python. (lightweight)
	<li> Write custom WebKit adapters for your favorite web server for enhanced performance. (fairly lightweight)
	<li> Write an article about using Webware. (middleweight)
	<li> Write a tutorial. (middleweight)
	<li> Build up regression test suites to help with testing and ensure future stability. (middleweight)
	<li> Contribute to the implementation of components such as WebKit and PSP. (heavyweight)
	<li> Contribute something else you might think of that we haven't.
</ul>

<h2>Design Points</h2>

<ul>
	<li> Webware is pro-Python. These software components are not about Java, C++ or any other programming languages.
	<li> The various software components are meant to be accessible in a stand alone fashion except in those cases where one component builds on another. That doesn't preclude the idea that the components can provide hooks for integration or even automatically integrate other components when their presence is detected.
	<li> A clean, object-oriented style of development is used as much as possible.
	<li> However, Webware components don't provide a special class for each type of HTML tag. It's generally easier and more efficient to use strings like '&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;' than to say something like 'BreakLine() + HorizontalRule()'.
	<li> Documentation is meant to be of the highest caliber so that users can more quickly get up and running with Webware.
	<li> All components are accompanied by examples (that also serve as tests).
	<li> Over time, regression tests are created and expanded upon for each component.
	<li> Although Webware includes more than one independent component, it's not intended to be a hodge-podge repository of any kind of web component written in Python. New components should fit into the 'feel' of what's there already and provide integration with other components whereever possible. The emphasis is on high-quality, object-oriented components (with the mild exception of the utility collections, MiscUtils and WebUtils).
</ul>
