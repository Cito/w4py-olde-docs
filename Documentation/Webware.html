<h1>Webware for Python</h1>
Release 0.2 on 5/12/2000
<br><a href=http://webware.sourceforge.net>http://webware.sourceforge.net</a>


<h2>Synopsis</h2>


<p> Webware for Python is a suite of software components for developing web-based applications. Key points include:

<ul>
	<li> Python-oriented.
	<li> Object-oriented.
	<li> An expansive suite of components and features.
	<li> Components that can be used together or independently.
	<li> Excellent documentation.
	<li> Numerous examples.
	<li> Open source development and community.
</ul>


<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p> Webware is open source and feedback in all areas (concept, design, code, documentation, packaging, etc.) is appreciated. Please e-mail Chuck Esterbrook at <a href="mailto:echuck@mindspring.com">echuck@mindspring.com</a> with any questions/comments or even an offer to help.


<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Each component has a focused purpose and can often be used on it's own. At the same time, the components are designed to work together where appropriate. As a user of Webware, you can bite off as much or as little as you want to chew.

<p> Webware for Python contains the following components:<br>(Note that PSP and MiddleKit aren't effectively there yet.)

	<td> <b>WebUtils</b> </td>
	<td align=center> 0.2 </td>
	<td> <a href="../WebUtils/Documentation/WebUtils.html">Docs</a> </td>
	<td> WebUtils are a basic set of functions for common web related programming tasks such encoding/decoding HTML, etc.</td>

	<td> <b>CGI Wrapper</b> </th>
	<td align=center> 0.2 </td>
	<td> <a href="../CGIWrapper/Documentation/CGIWrapper.html">Docs</a> </td>
	<td> The CGI Wrapper is a CGI script used to execute other Python CGI scripts. The wrapper provides convenient access to form fields and headers, exception catching, and usage and performance logging. Hooks are provided for cookies and class-based CGI scripts. </td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
	<td> <b>WebKit</b> </td>
	<td align=center> 0.2 </td>
	<td> <a href="../WebKit/Documentation/WebKit.html">Docs</a> </td>
	<td> WebKit provides Python classes for generating dynamic content from a web-based, server-side application. It is a significantly more powerful alternative to CGI scripts for application-oriented development. WebKit is analogous to NeXT/Apple's WebObjects and Sun's Servlets. </td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top bgcolor=#CCCCCC>
	<td> Python Server Pages (PSP) </td>
	<td align=center> NOT YET </td>
	<td> <a href="../PSP/Documentation/PSP.html">Docs</a> </td>
	<td> A Python Server Page (or PSP) is an HTML document with interspersed Python instructions that are interpreted to generate dynamic content. PSP is analgous to PHP, Microsoft's ASP and Sun's JSP. </td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top bgcolor=#CCCCCC>
	<td> MiddleKit </td>
	<td align=center> NOT YET </td>
	<td> <a href="../MiddleKit/Documentation/MiddleKit.html">Docs</a> </td>
	<td> For building the "middle tier" of an application server, that is, the domain-specific objects in between the front end and the database/datastore. MiddleKit is roughly analogous to NeXT/Apple's Enterprise Objects and Sun's Enterprise Java Beans.</a> </td>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p> Webware is fairly new and as such has a long way to go. If you are interested in contributing please contact <a href="mailto:echuck@mindspring.com">echuck@mindspring.com</a>.

<p> You can also keep up on new releases through the <a href=http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/webware-announce>announcement list</a> and the home page at <a href=http://webware.sourceforge.net>http://webware.sourceforge.net</a>.

<p> <b>Warning:</b> Since this version is pre-1.0 there is the possibility that things can get rewritten and more importantly, redesigned. Although there is an emphasis on stablizing the API as soon as possible, there is no guarantee or even attempt at backwards compatibility for new releases at this point in time.

<h2>Ground Rules</h2>

<ul>
	<li> Misc
		<ul>
		<li> Webware is pro-Python. These software components are not about Java, C++ or any programming languages.
		<li> The various software components are meant to be accessible in a stand alone fashion except in those cases where one component builds on another. That doesn't preclude the idea that the components can provide hooks for integration or even automatically integrate other components when their presence is detected.
		<li> A clean, object-oriented style of development is used as much as possible.
		<li> However, Webware components don't provide a special class for each type of HTML tag. It's generally easier and more efficient to use strings like '&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;' than to say something like 'BreakLine() + HorizontalRule()'.
		<li> Documentation is meant to be of the highest caliber so that users can more quickly get up and running with Webware.
		<li> All components are accompanied by examples that also serve as tests.
		<li> Although Webware includes more than one independent component, it's not intended to be a hodge-podge repository of any kind of web component written in Python. New components should fit into the 'feel' of what's there already and provide integration with other components whereever possible. The emphasis is on high-quality object-oriented components (with the mild exception of WebUtils).
		</ul>
	<li> Source Code Conventions
		<ul>
		<li>Misc
			<ul>
			<li> Tabs are used for source indentation and set to 4 spaces in width.
			</ul>
		<li> Naming Conventions
			<ul>
			<li> The suffix <em>Kit</em>, indicates an object-oriented framework.
			<li> The suffix <em>Utils</em>, indicates a miscellaneous collection of functions, data and classes.
			<li> The convention for naming methods is <code>name()</code> and <code>setName()</code> (as opposed to <code>getName()</code>, <code>setname()</code> or <code>set_name()</code>). Note that Python is inconsistent in this regard (<code>hasattr()</code>, <code>has_key()</code>), but it is ideal to pick a convention for a project and stick with it. The chosen convention for Webware is taken from Smalltalk and Objective-C and is fairly close to the Java convention.
			</ul>
		</ul>
</ul>
