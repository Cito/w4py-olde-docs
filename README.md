# Ye Olde Webware for Python Docs

Webware for Python is a suite of Python packages and tools for developing object-oriented, web-based applications. The suite uses well known design patterns and includes a fast Application Server, Servlets, Python Server Pages (PSP), Object-Relational Mapping, Task Scheduling, Session Management, and many other features. Webware is very modular and easily extended.

Webware for Python is well proven and platform-independent. It is compatible with multiple web servers, database servers and operating systems.
