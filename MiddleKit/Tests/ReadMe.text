The MiddleKit test suite is quite extensive. It's a great way to see if
MiddleKit is working on your system and it's essential to developing new
adapters.

To run the test suite, create a file, LocalConfig.py like so:

# LocalConfig.py
dbName = 'MySQL'
storeArgs = {'user': 'root', 'passwd': 'blarr'}
sqlCommand = 'mysql -u root -pblarr'
# end

Then to run all tests:
> python Test.py

When developing a new adapter, it is useful to run one test at a time:
> python MKBasic

Or a few:
> python MKBasic MKDateTime MKNone

Here is another example config file for a fresh MySQL 3.x installation on
Windows:

# LocalConfig.py
dbName = 'MySQL'
storeArgs = {'user': 'root'}
sqlCommand = 'C:\\mysql\\bin\\mysql -u root'
# end

You can see what databases are supported by looking in the MiddleKit/Run
directory. At the time I write this they are MySQL, PostgreSQL and MSSQL.
