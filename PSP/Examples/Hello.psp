<p>If you're running WebKit on Windows with the cgi adaptor, the image above will be broken.  You'll need to serve binary files from the WebServer itself.  We're working on a fix.  Sorry!

<p>PSP is a new addition to WebKit version 0.3.  It allows you to write a WebKit servlet using only html and interspersed python statements.

<p><h3>Read the documentation <a href="PSPDocs.psp">here</a>.</h3>


<br>
<p>The syntax for Python Server Pages is almost identical to that of Java Server Pages (JSP).  Just the scripting language is different! And obviously better.  In fact, just about anything you can do with JSP, you can do with PSP, and more.  With PSP, not only can you create template text that will be inerted in one method when the page is run as a servlet, but you can choose which base class to inherit from, you can choose which method of the base class to over-ride with your template text, and you can add additional methods to the servlet class, all from the PSP template code.  We have a bean equivalent called Can, too. (can of spam, get it?  That's OK, there are others who don't like it either).
<p>


<p>
<p>Since examples get added and removed here periodically, I'll just list links to the other examples below.  The main one is PSPTests.psp, which pretty much shows the syntax for PSP.  A truly wimpy Can example is at the bottom of PSPTests.
<p>
<%
import glob

filesyspath=self._request.serverSideDir()
files=glob.glob(os.path.join(filesyspath,"*.psp"))

%>

<% for i in files:%>
<% file=os.path.split(i)[1]%> <%-- AhHa! Here's where we need the complex block syntax. OKay.  --%>
<a href="<%=file%>"> <%= file %></a><br>
<% end %>
<p>
<p>So anyway, read through the docs, and look at PSPTests.psp for examples.  Let us know what we can do better or more effectively.
