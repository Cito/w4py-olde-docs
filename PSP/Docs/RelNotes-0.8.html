Version 0.8 beta 1

<a name=ReleaseNotes><h2>Release Notes</h2></a>

<ul>
	<li> Fixed a race condition that caused problems when multiple simultaneuos requests were made for a PSP that hadn't yet been imported.
	<li> PSP no longer sets the tempfile.tempdir module level variable (which affects tempfile.mktemp()).
	<li> The PSPReader module has been removed and replaced by the StreamReader.  StreamReader has been in use for some time, the presesnce of PSPReader was misleading.
</ul>
