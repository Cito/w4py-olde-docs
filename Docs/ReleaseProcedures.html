<pre><h1>Release Procedures</h1>Webware for Python

<h2>Preface</h2>
These notes have expanded and changed upon every release. Carefully,
consider each step as you make it. Look for opportunities to
improve. Also, update these notes immediately following a release.

<h2>To Do</h2>
* Document tests to run.
* Add notes on download mirror
  scp Webware-VER.tar.gz esterbro@ebad.pair.com:public_html/python/webware/
  @@ sgd 2003-02-13 Is the mirror really used? 

<h2>Changes encountered in the 0.8 Release</h2>
* Download mirror requires updating by Chuck, the instructuions for 

<h2>Last minute tweaks</h2>
* Run all regression test suites
  > cd SomeKit/Tests
  > python Test.py

* Release notes
  * Search webware-discuss and webware-devel archives for "update"
    in the subject, since the date of the last release.

* Update all version numbers using bin/serversion.py

  * edit bin/setversion.py and set the version numbers to match the release.

  * Copy */Docs/RelNotes-X.Y.html to RelNotes-#.#.html where #.# matches the
    major and minor version numbers on the release.    bin/setversion.py will
    only update RelNotes* files that are named according to the version 
    number so that it will not update old RelNotes files.

  * run bin/setversion.py  this will change the version in the following files
    according to defined rules.  See setversion.py for more information.
    * Properties.py
    * */Properties.py
    * */Docs/*.html
    * */Docs/*.txt
    * */Docs/RelNotes-#.#.html

* Make sure there are no empty directories or zero length files
  (such as __init__.py). Old unarchivers often ignore these, leading
  to problems for users.

* Make sure the workspace is up to date and all files are checked in.
  > cvs upd -dP

* Skim through docs one final time
  * Make sure all the version numbers and release dates are correct.


<h2>Prep release</h2>
Releases often go alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, ... with
suffixes a1, a2, b1, b2 as in 0.6.1b1.

Must be done on UNIX (or permissions are lost).

For CVS tagging only:  Use _ instead of .  No .:, or other symbols
For example,
   VER = 0.4
   CVS_VER = 0_4
Look at the existing tags to make sure your new tag is of a 
suitable style.  For example Release-0_8 is the tag for the
0.8 release.

* Make sure Properties.py's version has an a1, a2, b1, or b2, etc. 
  (see bin/setversion.py)

* Make sure verything is committed and current in CVS.

* Tag the release
  > cvs -q tag Release-CVS_VER

* Use ReleaseHelper to create the release. This performs a a CVS 
  EXPORT of the repository to create a directory without the CVS 
  control files, and then build a tarball from that directory.

  > Webware/bin/ReleaseHelper.py [tag=CVS_TAG]

  If you specify the tag=TAG, the tarball is built using the revision 
  informationfound in the release.  Otherwise the tarball is built
  and named with the current date indicating a snapshot build.

* Install and test
  * Check that the right versions show up in the WebKit examples, and
    in the documentation.

* If you want to get a particular release:
  > cvs co -r Release-CVS_VER Webware

* If you need to update something because you discovered a problem
  while confirming the release, and need to update the tag on
  the files, you can use "-F" option on cvs as in:
  > cvs -q tag -F Release-CVS_VER
  This forces the tag to move rather than giving an error that the
  tag already exists.

* Following these procedures assures that the CVS tagged version 
  is what is actually in the released tarball.

<h2>Release on SourceForge</h2>
FTP to SourceForge.net:

> ncftpput -V upload.sourceforge.net /incoming Webware-VER.tar.gz

* Log into <a href=http://sourceforge.net>sourceforge.net</a>.
* Go to the <a href=https://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4866>Webware Project Page</a> @ SourceForge.
* Click 'Admin' in the top menu bar.
* Click 'Edit/Release Files' in the second menu bar.
* Proceed to completion, but don't send users notification of
  release until final test is performed and the web site is updated.
* Reference for the above: <a href=http://sfdocs.sourceforge.net/sfdocs/display_topic.php?topicid=22>"Making File Releases"</a>

* Download the release and test.
* Review the trove categorization and update if necessary
  * Go to Admin
  * Read down and see the link for trove categorization


<h2>Update Home Page</h2>
<a href=http://webware.sourceforge.net>Webware Home Page</a>:

* Updates to the home page should go through CVS. In general
  you should not be editing files directly on the HomePage site
  because that site only has read-only access to CVS.

  * Update your own copy of the HomePage
    > cvs co HomePage
    * Update:
      * Last updated (at top of page)
      * Version number, including links
      * File size
      * Project status
      * Testimonials
    * Review all text and links
    * commit the changes to CVS
    
* You have to copy and install Webware in the web page directory so
  the documentation can be browsed online:  Make sure you install
  this from the tarball.

  * copy the tarball to your source forge account.
  > scp Webware-VER.tar.gz $USER@webware.sf.net:

  * login to the source forge account and extract the tarball.
  > ssh $USER@webware.sourceforge.net

    * Note: this assumes you are extracting into Webware/
      If the tarball extracts into a directory with the version
      number appended you will need to take that into account.

    > cd /home/groups/w/we/webware/htdocs/
    > rm -rf Webware
    > tar xzf ~/Webware-VER.tar.gz
    > cd Webware
    > python install.py

    * Update the HomePage on SF from CVS.
    > cvs -q update -dP

  * verify that the home page changes are correct by browsing to
    <a href="http://webware.sf.net">Webware.sourceforge.net</a> and double-checking
    all of the updated links, including the download link.

* Add a news item to the <a href=https://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4866>Webware Project Page</a> @ SourceForge
