    <h1>Webware for Python 0.8 beta 1 Release Notes</h1>

<ul>
<li> All adapters have been moved to Webware/WebKit/Adapters
<li> LRWPAdapter added, for use with the 
     <a href="http://xitami.com">Xitami web server</a>
<li> New <code>setCookie</code> method in <code>HTTPResponse</code>.
     New method supports setting the expire time, path (which 
     defaults to "/") and security flag.  The expire time can
     be set with constants "ONCLOSE", "NOW", or "NEVER"; or 
     you can give an integer timestamp, tuple of integers (as
     used in the time module), DateTime object, DateTimeDelta
     object, or string identifier (like "+1w" for 1 week in the 
     future).
<li> Added an <i>experimental</i> HTTPAdapter.py which serves directly as an HTTP server.
<li> Improvements to profilling.
<li> Numerous bug fixes.
</ul>

Many more improvements and bug fixes are present in this release.  The
majority of which can be found in WebKit.  Check out the WebKit <a
