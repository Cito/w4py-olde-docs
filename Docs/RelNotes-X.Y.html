<ul>

<li><p>the semantics for the awake-respond-sleep cycle have changed so
that Servlet.sleep() is <em>always</em> called, even when an
unhandled exception occurs in Servlet.awake() or Servlet.respond().
Servlet.sleep() is called even when Page.endResponse() or
Page.sendRedirectAndEnd() have been called to end servlet
processing prematurely.  This behaviour differs from previous
versions, in which sleep() was called only if awake() succeeded.</p>
<p>The intent of this change is to guarantee servlets the chance to free
resources, without having to be prepared to catch all possible exceptions
within awake() to do so.</p>
<p>The programmer should ensure that sleep does not attempt to free
resources which were never allocated, as sleep() may be called even when
awake() did not succeed.</p>
<pre class="py">
	def awake(...):
		initialize resource A
		initialize resource B

	def sleep(...):
		if resource B was initialized:
			finalize resource B
		if resource A was initialized:
			finalize resource A
