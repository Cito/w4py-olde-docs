<h2>Minor API Changes</h2>
<ul>
	<li> <p>the semantics for the awake-respond-sleep cycle have changed so 
	that Servlet.sleep() is <em>always</em> called, even when an
	unhandled exception occurs in Servlet.awake() or Servlet.respond().  
	Servlet.sleep() is called even when Page.endResponse() or
	Page.sendRedirectAndEnd() have been called to end servlet
	processing prematurely.  This behaviour differs from previous
	versions, in which sleep() was called only if awake() succeeded.</p>

	<p>The intent of this change is to guarantee servlets the chance to free
	resources, without having to be prepared to catch all possible exceptions
	within awake() to do so.</p>

	<p>The programmer should ensure that sleep does not attempt to free
	resources which were never allocated, as sleep() may be called even when
	awake() did not succeed.</p>

<pre>
	def awake(...):
		initialize resource A
		initialize resource B

	def sleep(...):
		if resource B was initialized:
			finalize resource B
		if resource A was initialized:
			finalize resource A
</pre></li>
